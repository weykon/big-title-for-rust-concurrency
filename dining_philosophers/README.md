> Five philosophers dine together at the same table. Each philosopher has their own place at the table. There is a fork between each plate. The dish served is a kind of spaghetti which has to be eaten with two forks. Each philosopher can only alternately think and eat. Moreover, a philosopher can only eat their spaghetti when they have both a left and right fork. Thus two forks will only be available when their two nearest neighbors are thinking, not eating. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they will put down both forks.

- 五位哲学家同桌用餐。每个哲学家都有自己的位置。每个盘子之间有一个叉子。上的菜是一种意大利面，必须用两把叉子吃。每个哲学家只能轮流思考和进食。此外，哲学家吃意大利面时，必须同时使用左右叉。因此，只有当他们最近的两个邻居在思考而不是吃东西时，两把叉子才会可用。每个哲学家吃完东西后，就会放下叉子。
